Task 1 - Setup Lab Environment
-----------------------------------

To access your dedicated student lab environment, you will require a web browser and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. The web browser will be used to access the Lab Training Portal. The RDP client will be used to connect to the Jump Host, where you will be able to access the BIG-IP management interfaces (HTTPS, SSH).

#. Click **DEPLOYMENT** located on the top left corner to display the environment

#. Click **ACCESS** next to jumpohost.f5lab.local

#. Select your RDP solution.  

#. The RDP client on your local host establishes a RDP connection to the Jump Host.

#. Login with the following credentials:

         - User: **f5lab\\user1**
         - Password: **user1**

#. After successful logon the Chrome browser will auto launch opening the site https://portal.f5lab.local.  This process usually takes 30 seconds after logon.

#. Click the **Classes** tab at the top of the page.
