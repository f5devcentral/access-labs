Lab 1: APM GUI Overview
===========================================

Objectives
----------

The intention of this lab will be to show how to enable Access Policy Manager (APM) through resource provisioning.  Next we will explore all the components within the **Access** left menu.
This is not a deep dive on the components but an overview of the components, features and concepts of APM.

Lab Requirements
----------------

-  A pre existing virtual server at IP and DNS Name

Setup Lab Environment
-----------------------------------

To access your dedicated student lab environment, you will require a web browser and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client software. The web browser will be used to access the Lab Training Portal. The RDP client will be used to connect to the Jump Host, where you will be able to access the BIG-IP management interfaces (HTTPS, SSH).

#. Click **DEPLOYMENT** located on the top left corner to display the environment

#. Click **ACCESS** next to jumpohost.f5lab.local

   |accessjh|

#. Select your RDP solution.

#. The RDP client on your local host establishes a RDP connection to the Jump Host.

#. Login with the following credentials:

         - User: **f5lab\\user1**
         - Password: **user1**

#. After successful logon the Chrome browser will auto launch opening the site https://portal.f5lab.local.  This process usually takes 30 seconds after logon.

#. Click the **Classes** tab at the top of the page.

#. Scroll down the page until you see **101 Intro to Access Foundational Concepts** on the left

#. Hover over tile **APM GUI Overview**. A start and stop icon should appear within the tile.  Click the **Play** Button to start the automation to build the environment

#. The screen should refresh displaying the progress of the automation within 30 seconds.  Scroll to the bottom of the automation workflow to ensure all requests succeeded.  If you experience errors try running the automation a second time or open an issue on the `Access Labs Repo <https://github.com/f5devcentral/access-labs>`__.

Task 1: Resource Provisioning
---------------------------------------
Access Policy Manager (APM) is a module available for use on the BIG-IP platform (Hardware and Virtual).  Unlike other modules, APM can be provisioned with limited functionality on any BIG-IP platform without a specific license (`see F5 KB15854 <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K15854>`__).  APM is licensed based on the number of Access Sessions and Concurrent Users Sessions (`see APM Operations Guide <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K72971039>`__). You can provision APM limited and immediately start using all the functions of APM with a limitation of 10 Access and Concurrent user session.

#. Log in to bigip1.f5lab.local with administrative credentials provided
#. On the left menu navigate to **System** --> **Resource Provisioning**
#. Click box and on the drop down next to the module and choose **Nominal**

      .. Note:: In most use cases you will want to use **Nominal** for provisioning modules.  What does each setting mean?
      +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |Dedicated      |Specifies that all resources are dedicated to the module you are provisioning. For all |
      |               |other modules, the level option must be set to none.                                   |
      +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |Minimum        |Specifies that you want to provision the minimum amount of  resources for the module   |
      |               |you are provisioning.                                                                  |
      +---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |Nominal        |Specifies that you want to share all of the available resources equally among all of   |
      |               |the modules that are licensed on the unit.                                             |

      .. Important::  APM has already been provisioned for this lab.  The next step would be completed if you are provisioning on your own BIG-IP.

Lab 2 is now complete.
